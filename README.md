### Install dependencies

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Create an `.env` file and enter the missing details (token from
[developers portal][dev-portal] and ID's).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run the application

To run it on your development setup, you can either run the python file
(main.py), run it as single docker container by building and running the
container with docker compose.

#### Python

The simplest is to run the python file directly with:

```bash
python main.py
```

#### docker-compose

Use docker compose to build and run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
